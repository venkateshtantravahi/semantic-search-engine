http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13448v1,"CIE: Controlling Language Model Text Generations Using Continuous
  Signals","Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant
to enhance user experience. This calls for designing methods that can allow
users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate. For example,
controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that
gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc. Most existing work attempts to integrate
users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or
discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale. In this
work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist
along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or
via existing techniques in conditional generation. Through a case study in
controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we
demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be
controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a
""low"" and a ""high"" token embedding. Our method more reliably exerts
response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods
that represent the control signal as a discrete signal. Our full open-sourced
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/vsamuel2003/CIE.",2025-05-19T17:59:58Z,"Vinay Samuel, Harshita Diddee, Yiming Zhang, Daphne Ippolito"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13445v1,"Trust, But Verify: A Self-Verification Approach to Reinforcement
  Learning with Verifiable Rewards","Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement
strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where
models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE
(Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework
designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to
improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a
single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging
verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for
both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the
model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated
solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive
experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE
consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently
fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the
advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification
compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate
self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE
as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware
reasoners.",2025-05-19T17:59:31Z,"Xiaoyuan Liu, Tian Liang, Zhiwei He, Jiahao Xu, Wenxuan Wang, Pinjia He, Zhaopeng Tu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu"

visual reasoning capabilities. However, current LVLMs exhibit a notable
imbalance between these skills, falling short on visual reasoning that is
difficult to perform in text. We conduct a case study using a synthetic dataset
solvable only through visual reasoning and show that model performance degrades

reasoning types, curated from real-world charts across 184 sources,
specifically built to evaluate complex visual and textual reasoning. Unlike
prior chart understanding benchmarks -- where frontier models perform similarly

although humans achieve 93% accuracy, the best-performing model Gemini-2.5-Pro

http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13438v1,Optimizing Anytime Reasoning via Budget Relative Policy Optimization,"Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities
of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ
reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end
of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance
under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to
optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency
and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To
achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled
token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the
optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces
verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more
effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking
and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward.
Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget
Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency
of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results
in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions,
enhancing both training and token efficiency.",2025-05-19T17:58:44Z,"Penghui Qi, Zichen Liu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Wee Sun Lee, Min Lin"

Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) to textual data. Our method generates new
synthetic examples by interpolating between BERT-based embeddings of two
existing examples and then decoding the resulting latent point into text with
xRAG architecture. By leveraging xRAG's cross-modal retrieval-generation

While this is preliminary work supported by qualitative outputs only, the
method shows strong potential for knowledge distillation and data augmentation

http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13430v1,Fine-tuning Quantized Neural Networks with Zeroth-order Optimization,"As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has
become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this
paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing
memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a
unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states
using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing
weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize
memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from
bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to
quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete
weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization
and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized
Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous
quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative
clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based
and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to
full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by
more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and

http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13418v1,"Dementia Through Different Eyes: Explainable Modeling of Human and LLM
  Perceptions for Early Awareness","Cognitive decline often surfaces in language years before diagnosis. It is
frequently non-experts, such as those closest to the patient, who first sense a
change and raise concern. As LLMs become integrated into daily communication
and used over prolonged periods, it may even be an LLM that notices something
is off. But what exactly do they notice--and should be noticing--when making
that judgment? This paper investigates how dementia is perceived through
language by non-experts. We presented transcribed picture descriptions to
non-expert humans and LLMs, asking them to intuitively judge whether each text
was produced by someone healthy or with dementia. We introduce an explainable
method that uses LLMs to extract high-level, expert-guided features
representing these picture descriptions, and use logistic regression to model
human and LLM perceptions and compare with clinical diagnoses. Our analysis
reveals that human perception of dementia is inconsistent and relies on a
narrow, and sometimes misleading, set of cues. LLMs, by contrast, draw on a
richer, more nuanced feature set that aligns more closely with clinical
patterns. Still, both groups show a tendency toward false negatives, frequently
overlooking dementia cases. Through our interpretable framework and the
insights it provides, we hope to help non-experts better recognize the
linguistic signs that matter.",2025-05-19T17:51:35Z,"Lotem Peled-Cohen, Maya Zadok, Nitay Calderon, Hila Gonen, Roi Reichart"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13417v1,AdaptThink: Reasoning Models Can Learn When to Think,"Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on
various tasks by employing human-like deep thinking. However, the lengthy
thinking process substantially increases inference overhead, making efficiency
a critical bottleneck. In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking,
which prompts the reasoning model to skip thinking and directly generate the
final solution, is a better choice for relatively simple tasks in terms of both
performance and efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose AdaptThink, a novel
RL algorithm to teach reasoning models to choose the optimal thinking mode
adaptively based on problem difficulty. Specifically, AdaptThink features two
core components: (1) a constrained optimization objective that encourages the
model to choose NoThinking while maintaining the overall performance; (2) an
importance sampling strategy that balances Thinking and NoThinking samples
during on-policy training, thereby enabling cold start and allowing the model
to explore and exploit both thinking modes throughout the training process. Our
experiments indicate that AdaptThink significantly reduces the inference costs
while further enhancing performance. Notably, on three math datasets,
AdaptThink reduces the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B

Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising
performance in solving complex tasks. LRMs solve tasks that require complex
reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with
answers. Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy
because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the
soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well. Logically, if the
soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the
confidence of the derived answer should be low. Existing methods did consider
jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the
reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the
causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly
reflected. In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel
approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation. Specifically, our
CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process,
which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle
kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field. Our CoT-Kinetics energy
assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning

Language Models (MLLMs) as evaluative judges has emerged as an effective
approach in RLHF and inference-time scaling. In this work, we propose
Multimodal Reasoner as a Judge (MR. Judge), a paradigm for empowering
general-purpose MLLMs judges with strong reasoning capabilities. Instead of
directly assigning scores for each response, we formulate the judgement process
as a reasoning-inspired multiple-choice problem. Specifically, the judge model
first conducts deliberate reasoning covering different aspects of the responses
and eventually selects the best response from them. This reasoning process not
only improves the interpretibility of the judgement, but also greatly enhances
the performance of MLLM judges. To cope with the lack of questions with scored
responses, we propose the following strategy to achieve automatic annotation:
1) Reverse Response Candidates Synthesis: starting from a supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) dataset, we treat the original response as the best candidate
and prompt the MLLM to generate plausible but flawed negative candidates. 2)
Text-based reasoning extraction: we carefully design a data synthesis pipeline
for distilling the reasoning capability from a text-based reasoning model,
which is adopted to enable the MLLM judges to regain complex reasoning ability
via warm up supervised fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our MR. Judge

learn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable
framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and
long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.
Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two
control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed
reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy
Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of
hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the
selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the
accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables
fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing
training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.
Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and

generating responses related to the forget target, without destroying the
fluency of text generation. In this work, we propose Generation-time Unlearning
via Adaptive Restriction and Detection (GUARD), a framework that enables
dynamic unlearning during LLM generation. Specifically, we first employ a
prompt classifier to detect unlearning targets and extract the corresponding
forbidden token. We then dynamically penalize and filter candidate tokens
during generation using a combination of token matching and semantic matching,
effectively preventing the model from leaking the forgotten content.
Experimental results on copyright content unlearning tasks over the Harry
Potter dataset and the MUSE benchmark, as well as entity unlearning tasks on
the TOFU dataset, demonstrate that GUARD achieves strong forget quality across
various tasks while causing almost no degradation to the LLM's general
capabilities, striking an excellent trade-off between forgetting and utility.",2025-05-19T16:26:58Z,"Zhijie Deng, Chris Yuhao Liu, Zirui Pang, Xinlei He, Lei Feng, Qi Xuan, Zhaowei Zhu, Jiaheng Wei"

  in Latent Space","Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose
a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI.
Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law,
significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training
algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of
novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning
performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating.
Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose
leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to
the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that
enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA)
within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy
gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated
reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks,
including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures.
Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our
analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging
within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also
benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of
test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a

mechanisms. However, two primary challenges remain for real-world applications:
(1) the lack of quantitative metrics and actionable guidelines for evaluating
and optimizing measurable boundaries of CoT capability, and (2) the absence of
methods to assess boundaries of unmeasurable CoT capability, such as multimodal
perception. To address these gaps, we introduce the Reasoning Boundary
Framework++ (RBF++). To tackle the first challenge, we define the reasoning
boundary (RB) as the maximum limit of CoT performance. We also propose a
combination law for RBs, enabling quantitative analysis and offering actionable
guidance across various CoT tasks. For the second challenge, particularly in
multimodal scenarios, we introduce a constant assumption, which replaces
unmeasurable RBs with scenario-specific constants. Additionally, we propose the
reasoning boundary division mechanism, which divides unmeasurable RBs into two
sub-boundaries, facilitating the quantification and optimization of both
unmeasurable domain knowledge and multimodal perception capabilities. Extensive

jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from
VLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments;
and a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired
with corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across

thereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key

prefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization
decreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp
decline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of
the context window. We attribute this to positional fragility: models rely
disproportionately on the earliest tokens in their context window as retrieval
anchors, making them sensitive to even slight shifts. We further observe that
when the model fails to retrieve memorized content, it often produces
degenerated text. Leveraging these findings, we show that shifting sensitive

communication are inherently subtle, even more so in text-only communication.
Yet, prior studies have reported considerable success in automatic deception
detection. We hypothesize that such findings are largely driven by artifacts
introduced during data collection and do not generalize beyond specific
datasets. We revisit this assumption by introducing a belief-based deception
framework, which defines deception as a misalignment between an author's claims
and true beliefs, irrespective of factual accuracy, allowing deception cues to
be studied in isolation. Based on this framework, we construct three corpora,
collectively referred to as DeFaBel, including a German-language corpus of
deceptive and non-deceptive arguments and a multilingual version in German and
English, each collected under varying conditions to account for belief change
and enable cross-linguistic analysis. Using these corpora, we evaluate commonly
reported linguistic cues of deception. Across all three DeFaBel variants, these
cues show negligible, statistically insignificant correlations with deception
labels, contrary to prior work that treats such cues as reliable indicators. We
further benchmark against other English deception datasets following similar
data collection protocols. While some show statistically significant
correlations, effect sizes remain low and, critically, the set of predictive
cues is inconsistent across datasets. We also evaluate deception detection
using feature-based models, pretrained language models, and instruction-tuned
large language models. While some models perform well on established deception
datasets, they consistently perform near chance on DeFaBel. Our findings

the shared representation compared to smaller models, but are nevertheless more
capable of retrieving knowledge embedded across different languages. Finally,

their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank
approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches
have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of
individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics
of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small
low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to
other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce
runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small
matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a
post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a
Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$,
and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical
solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while
minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention

directly eliciting the chain of thoughts from partial information, LoT

deceptive form of model error has emerged--Reasoning Hallucination--where
logically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive

Synthesize-then-Decode (SynDec) approach, which automatically synthesizes
high-quality prompts and amplifies their roles during decoding process.
Specifically, our approach synthesizes prompts by selecting representative
few-shot samples, conducting a four-dimensional style analysis, and reranking
the candidates. At LLM decoding stage, the TST effect is amplified by
maximizing the contrast in output probabilities between scenarios with and
without the synthesized prompt, as well as between prompts and negative

  Calibration","Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is an efficient position encoding approach
and is widely utilized in numerous large language models (LLMs). Recently, a
lot of methods have been put forward to further expand the context window based
on RoPE. The core concept of those methods is to predefine or search for a set
of factors to rescale the base frequencies of RoPE. Nevertheless, it is quite a
challenge for existing methods to predefine an optimal factor due to the
exponential search space. In view of this, we introduce PSC (Phase Shift
Calibration), a small module for calibrating the frequencies predefined by
existing methods. With the employment of PSC, we demonstrate that many existing
methods can be further enhanced, like PI, YaRN, and LongRoPE. We conducted
extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks. The results demonstrate
that (1) when PSC is enabled, the comparative reductions in perplexity increase
as the context window size is varied from 16k, to 32k, and up to 64k. (2) Our
approach is broadly applicable and exhibits robustness across a variety of

http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12398v1,Traversal Verification for Speculative Tree Decoding,"Speculative decoding is a promising approach for accelerating large language
models. The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the
output of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify
them in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or
rejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct
token trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their
reliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical
limitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from
that of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second,
current verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by
layer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes
should be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative
candidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative
decoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm
through leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the
entire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves
potentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing
methods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained
through Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model,
guaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains.

However, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be

validity (i.e., formal inference). This can result in biased inferences, where
plausible arguments are incorrectly deemed logically valid or vice versa.
Mitigating this limitation is critical, as it undermines the trustworthiness
and generalizability of LLMs in applications that demand rigorous logical
consistency. This paper investigates the problem of mitigating content biases
on formal reasoning through activation steering. Specifically, we curate a
controlled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from
content plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and
material inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for
test-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs
reveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over
content biases. However, we observe that a static approach is insufficient for
improving all the tested models. We then leverage the possibility to control
content effects by dynamically determining the value of the steering parameters
via fine-grained conditional methods. We found that conditional steering is
effective on unresponsive models, achieving up to 15% absolute improvement in
formal reasoning accuracy with a newly introduced kNN-based method (K-CAST).
Finally, additional experiments reveal that steering for content effects is
robust to prompt variations, incurs minimal side effects on language modeling
capabilities, and can partially generalize to out-of-distribution reasoning

setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming.
We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found

processing and generative AI, driving progress across various aspects of modern
society. Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e.,
predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their
application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible
decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and
practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and
trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given
sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding
prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence.
The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit
notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous
approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time
adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior
knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on
the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in
how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically,
using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27
percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness,
equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or
training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical

  productivity: A sketch of an integrative approach","In this study, we approach morphological productivity from two perspectives:
a cognitive-computational perspective, and a diachronic perspective zooming in
on an actual speaker, Thomas Mann. For developing the first perspective, we
make use of a cognitive computational model of the mental lexicon, the
discriminative lexicon model. For computational mappings between form and
meaning to be productive, in the sense that novel, previously unencountered
words, can be understood and produced, there must be systematicities between
the form space and the semantic space. If the relation between form and meaning
would be truly arbitrary, a model could memorize form and meaning pairings, but
there is no way in which the model would be able to generalize to novel test
data. For Finnish nominal inflection, Malay derivation, and English
compounding, we explore, using the Discriminative Lexicon Model as a
computational tool, to trace differences in the degree to which inflectional
and word formation patterns are productive. We show that the DLM tends to
associate affix-like sublexical units with the centroids of the embeddings of
the words with a given affix. For developing the second perspective, we study
how the intake and output of one prolific writer, Thomas Mann, changes over
time. We show by means of an examination of what Thomas Mann is likely to have
read, and what he wrote, that the rate at which Mann produces novel derived
words is extremely low. There are far more novel words in his input than in his
output. We show that Thomas Mann is less likely to produce a novel derived word
with a given suffix the greater the average distance is of the embeddings of
all derived words to the corresponding centroid, and discuss the challenges of
using speaker-specific embeddings for low-frequency and novel words.",2025-05-17T16:21:49Z,"Harald Baayen, Kristian Berg, Maziyah Mohamed"

Specially, we employ knowledge stream analysis at the macroscopic level, and
investigate the function of individual modules at the microscopic level.
Drawing on knowledge streaming analyses, we decompose the knowledge utilization

Post-training LLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to
improve their ability to follow instructions. In addressing complex instruction
following, existing efforts primarily focus on data-driven methods that
synthesize complex instruction-output pairs for SFT. However, insufficient
attention allocated to crucial sub-contexts may reduce the effectiveness of
SFT. In this work, we propose transforming sequentially structured input
instruction into multiple parallel instructions containing subcontexts. To
support processing this multi-input, we propose MISO (Multi-Input
Single-Output), an extension to currently dominant decoder-only
transformer-based LLMs. MISO introduces a mixture-of-contexts paradigm that
jointly considers the overall instruction-output alignment and the influence of
individual sub-contexts to enhance SFT effectiveness. We apply MISO fine-tuning
to complex instructionfollowing datasets and evaluate it with standard LLM
inference. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of MISO as a
fine-tuning method for LLMs, both in terms of effectiveness in complex

http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11754v1,"Masking in Multi-hop QA: An Analysis of How Language Models Perform with
  Context Permutation","Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) adds layers of complexity to question
answering, making it more challenging. When Language Models (LMs) are prompted
with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant
information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information
sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the
causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In
this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting
search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study
reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the
ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in
MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order
of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned
decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order
aligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models
with bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively
boost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough
investigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of
MHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher
values when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to
heuristically improve LMs' performance on this task. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/hwy9855/MultiHopQA-Reasoning.",2025-05-16T23:29:47Z,"Wenyu Huang, Pavlos Vougiouklis, Mirella Lapata, Jeff Z. Pan"

classification, we explore whether masking input tokens can further enhance
their effectiveness. We propose token masking regularization, a simple yet
theoretically motivated method that randomly replaces input tokens with a
special [MASK] token at probability p. This introduces stochastic perturbations
during training, leading to implicit gradient averaging that encourages the
model to capture deeper inter-token dependencies. Experiments on language
identification and sentiment analysis -- across diverse models (mBERT,
Qwen2.5-0.5B, TinyLlama-1.1B) -- show consistent improvements over standard
regularization techniques. We identify task-specific optimal masking rates,
with p = 0.1 as a strong general default. We attribute the gains to two key

smoothing acts as implicit ensembling.",2025-05-16T23:06:11Z,"Xianglong Xu, John Bowen, Rojin Taheri"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11739v1,"ZeroTuning: Unlocking the Initial Token's Power to Enhance Large
  Language Models Without Training","Recently, training-free methods for improving large language models (LLMs)
have attracted growing interest, with token-level attention tuning emerging as
a promising and interpretable direction. However, existing methods typically
rely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific
tokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,
we uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial
token is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model
behavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's
attention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent
tokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,
we find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more
effectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a
consistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but
varies across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct
preferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we
propose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by
applying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite
tuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text
classification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across
models such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek. For example, ZeroTuning improves
Llama-3.1-8B by 11.71% on classification, 2.64% on QA tasks, and raises its
multi-turn score from 7.804 to 7.966. The method is also robust to limited
resources, few-shot settings, long contexts, quantization, decoding strategies,
and prompt variations. Our work sheds light on a previously overlooked control
point in LLMs, offering new insights into both inference-time tuning and model
interpretability.",2025-05-16T22:52:24Z,"Feijiang Han, Xiaodong Yu, Jianheng Tang, Lyle Ungar"

  Reinforcement Learning","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization
remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the
performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables
improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present
a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional
correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative
to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce
a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO,
achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3
baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including

help to handle the problem of imbalanced resources between two languages, while
also optimizing the training and computational processes. Additionally, we also
enhanced the datasets using data augmentation to generate additional resources

despite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to
evaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce
EmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion
hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from
the interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven
learning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology
provides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on
this, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology
knowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation,
we utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs
carefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion

created on top of the Quranic Consonantal Text (QCT) motivated the creation and
further development of a fine-grained system of phonetic notation that

prosodic processes. From a computational point of view, the text of the Cairo
Quran can be used as a linchpin to align and compare Quranic manuscripts, due
to its richness and completeness. This will let us create a very powerful

  Policy Optimization","While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly
improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models
(LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior
approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget
constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical
information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We
hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more
concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy
Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum
length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO
employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to
incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those
previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing
shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards
more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness
reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to
train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and
Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span
various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively
induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of
33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.",2025-05-16T13:21:28Z,"Chengyu Huang, Zhengxin Zhang, Claire Cardie"

text-to-speech (TTS) systems, enhancing control over speech style, naturalness,

System evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies,
and limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a
multi-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles,
context diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in
Chinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio
Turing Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired
with a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on
complex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge
whether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and
improves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we
also finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for
automatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively
differentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its
multi-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with

expressiveness of transformers; without them attention transformers reduce to a
bag-of-word model. NoPE-transformers (i.e. with No PEs) with unique hard
attention mechanisms were very recently shown to only be able to express
regular languages, i.e., with limited counting ability. This paper shows that,
with average hard attention mechanisms, NoPE-transformers are still
surprisingly expressive: they can express counting languages corresponding to
nonnegative integer solutions to multivariate polynomial equations (i.e.
Diophantine equations), reasoning about which is well-known to be undecidable.
In fact, we provide a precise characterization of languages expressible by
Average Hard Attention NoPE-Transformers (NoPE-AHATs): they correspond
precisely to what we call \emph{semi-algebraic sets}, i.e., finite unions of
sets of nonnegative integer solutions to systems of multivariate polynomial
inequations. We obtain several interesting consequences of our
characterization. Firstly, NoPE-transformers can express counting properties
that are far more complex than established models like simplified counter
machines and Petri nets, but cannot express a very simple counting property of
PARITY. Secondly, the problem of analyzing NoPE-transformers is undecidable,
e.g., whether a given NoPE transformer classifies all input strings in one
class. To complement our results, we exhibit a counting language that is not
expressible by average hard attention transformers even with arbitrary PEs but
is expressible in the circuit complexity class TC$^0$, answering an open

basis of most large language models. Given a sequence of previous values,
next-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the
vocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token
sequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead,
random sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their
consistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although
consistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a
well researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to
the best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction
converges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent
with outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability
distribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the
entire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all
probability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal
for a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see
that there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval
and creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing

Using adjustable per-image preferences, our method is easily scalable and

  for Cross-lingual Transfer","Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly incorporate multilingual
capabilities, fueling the demand to transfer them into target language-specific
models. However, most approaches, which blend the source model's embedding by
replacing the source vocabulary with the target language-specific vocabulary,
may constrain expressive capacity in the target language since the source model
is predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose Semantic
Aware Linear Transfer (SALT), a novel cross-lingual transfer technique that
recycles embeddings from target language Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to
transmit the deep representational strengths of PLM-derived embedding to LLMs.
SALT derives unique regression lines based on the similarity in the overlap of
the source and target vocabularies, to handle each non-overlapping token's
embedding space. Our extensive experiments show that SALT significantly
outperforms other transfer methods and achieves lower loss with accelerating
faster convergence during language adaptation. Notably, SALT obtains remarkable
performance in cross-lingual understanding setups compared to other methods.
Furthermore, we highlight the scalable use of PLMs to enhance the functionality

several modular approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. Yet,
we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general
knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular
framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of
task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this
general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual
modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information, a method we
call general knowledge subtraction (GenKnowSub). Leveraging the refined
task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm
\citep{ostapenko2024towards}, we dynamically select and combine modules for new
inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard
Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from
diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent
performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide

  Tasks","Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving through distributed information integration, but also risk
replicating collective reasoning failures observed in human groups. Yet, no
theory-grounded benchmark exists to systematically evaluate such failures. In
this paper, we introduce the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology as
a diagnostic testbed for multi-agent LLM systems. By distributing critical
information asymmetrically across agents, the paradigm reveals how inter-agent
dynamics support or hinder collective reasoning. We first formalize the
paradigm for multi-agent decision-making under distributed knowledge and
instantiate it as a benchmark with nine tasks spanning diverse scenarios,
including adaptations from prior human studies. We then conduct experiments
with GPT-4.1 and five other leading LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced

accuracy of single agents given complete information. While agents' collective
performance is broadly comparable to that of human groups, nuanced behavioral
differences emerge, such as increased sensitivity to social desirability.
Finally, we demonstrate the paradigm's diagnostic utility by exploring a
cooperation-contradiction trade-off in multi-agent LLM systems. We find that

increased contradiction impairs group convergence. This work contributes a

systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,
and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of

that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making

Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and

learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in
parallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely
parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing

observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this
neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model
size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs
represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,
representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur
with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss
scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only
the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of
loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature
frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong
superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,
the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide
range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is
explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower
dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales
inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced
LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match
the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also
agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an
important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate

  large-scale crowdsourced evaluation","Plain language summaries (PLSs) are essential for facilitating effective
communication between clinicians and patients by making complex medical
information easier for laypeople to understand and act upon. Large language
models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating PLS generation, but
their effectiveness in supporting health information comprehension remains
unclear. Prior evaluations have generally relied on automated scores that do
not measure understandability directly, or subjective Likert-scale ratings from
convenience samples with limited generalizability. To address these gaps, we
conducted a large-scale crowdsourced evaluation of LLM-generated PLSs using
Amazon Mechanical Turk with 150 participants. We assessed PLS quality through
subjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness,
coherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and
recall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the
alignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our
findings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear
indistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,
human-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,
automated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into
question their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to

has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the
generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on
content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition
problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is
structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in
various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently
reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition
and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for
Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems
in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to
identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically
decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,
thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we
construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches
for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive

unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn
undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their

shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random

flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the
interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary
biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,
adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and
phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to
environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability
dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic
encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We
experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and
systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in
Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high
environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp
transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL
efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics
reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift
occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we
demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL
acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding

  Adaptation and Supertoken Learning","Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed
tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations,
particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer
lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this
often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer
replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing
methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully
preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression
inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a
model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel
pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and
reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a
hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword
decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the
top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This
methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing
retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions:
the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly
outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including
Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression
gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid
initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both
ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly
trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity
ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement
in these aggregate scores.",2025-05-14T19:00:27Z,"Shaurya Sharthak, Vinayak Pahalwan, Adithya Kamath, Adarsh Shirawalmath"

decision-makers who need to actively gather information to guide their
decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient
exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to
robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs
possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous
conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal
relationships, using the well-established ""Blicket Test"" paradigm from
developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive
disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual,
yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This
""disjunctive bias"" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting
strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases.
Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs
may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data.
To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs
exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not children-like). Finally, we
propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates
hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach

perspective on how LMs become distracted by ``irrelevant'' contextual
information in the input prompt. Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher
logits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the
context prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual
entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the
relevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the
sentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of
contextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual
prompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while
contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic
factors.
  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment
heads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a
novel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we
identify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads,
i.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is
significantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates
to what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery

  Knowledge Bases","In many real-world settings, machine learning models and interactive systems
have access to both structured knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs or tables, and
unstructured content, e.g., natural language documents. However, most rely on
either. Semi-Structured Knowledge Bases (SKBs) bridge this gap by linking
unstructured content to nodes within structured data, thereby enabling new
strategies for knowledge access and use. In this work, we present
FocusedRetriever, a modular SKB-based framework for multi-hop question
answering. It integrates components (VSS-based entity search, LLM-based
generation of Cypher queries and pairwise re-ranking) in a way that enables it
to outperform state-of-the-art methods across all three STaRK benchmark test

first-hit rate exceeds that of the second-best method by 25.7%.
FocusedRetriever leverages (1) the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
extract relational facts and entity attributes from unstructured text, (2) node
set joins to filter answer candidates based on these extracted triplets and
constraints, (3) vector similarity search to retrieve and rank relevant

  Models","Spiking Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an energy-efficient
alternative to conventional LLMs through their event-driven computation. To
effectively obtain spiking LLMs, researchers develop different ANN-to-SNN
conversion methods by leveraging pre-trained ANN parameters while inheriting
the energy efficiency of SNN. However, existing conversion methods struggle
with extreme activation outliers and incompatible nonlinear operations of
ANN-based LLMs. To address this, we propose a loss-less ANN-SNN conversion for
fully spike-driven LLMs, termed LAS. Specifically, LAS introduces two novel
neurons to convert the activation outlier and nonlinear operation of ANN-based
LLMs. Moreover, LAS tailors the spike-equivalent Transformer components for
spiking LLMs, which can ensure full spiking conversion without any loss of
performance. Experimental results on six language models and two
vision-language models demonstrate that LAS achieves loss-less conversion.
Notably, on OPT-66B, LAS even improves the accuracy of 2\% on the WSC task. In

  Language Models","Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is
responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world
scenarios. However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC
theory, resulting in limited interpretability. Therefore, we propose AC-Reason,
a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events
within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g.,
sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a
theory-guided algorithm with explanations. While AC-Reason does not explicitly
construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal
structure to support principled reasoning. To enable comprehensive evaluation,
we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending
Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ). AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully
annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on
actual causation. The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench
present greater challenges for LLMs. Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and
AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over
baselines. On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy
of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%. On AC-Bench, GPT-4 +
AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. AC-Bench further
enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful

2,200 labeled instances that constitute the Easy-Level dataset. To increase
adversarial complexity, each instance is further transformed into a

role in solving a wide range of NLP tasks, leveraging their capabilities of
natural language understanding and generating. Integration with external tools
further enhances LLMs' effectiveness, providing more precise, timely, and
specialized responses. However, LLMs still encounter difficulties with
non-executable actions and improper actions, which are primarily attributed to
incorrect parameters. The process of generating parameters by LLMs is confined
to the tool level, employing the coarse-grained strategy without considering
the different difficulties of various tools. To address this issue, we propose
TUMS, a novel framework designed to enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs
by transforming tool-level processing into parameter-level processing.
Specifically, our framework consists of four key components: (1) an intent
recognizer that identifies the user's intent to help LLMs better understand the
task; (2) a task decomposer that breaks down complex tasks into simpler
subtasks, each involving a tool call; (3) a subtask processor equipped with
multi-structure handlers to generate accurate parameters; and (4) an executor.
Our empirical studies have evidenced the effectiveness and efficiency of the
TUMS framework with an average of 19.6\% and 50.6\% improvement separately on
easy and hard benchmarks of ToolQA, meanwhile, we demonstrated the key
contribution of each part with ablation experiments, offering more insights and

  Meets Dynamic Skipping","Large Language Models leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex
tasks, but their reasoning traces are often excessively verbose and
inefficient, leading to significant computational costs and latency. Current
CoT compression techniques typically rely on generic importance metrics and
static compression rates, which may inadvertently remove functionally critical
tokens or fail to adapt to varying reasoning complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Adaptive GoGI-Skip, a novel framework learning dynamic
CoT compression via supervised fine-tuning. This approach introduces two
synergistic innovations: (1) Goal-Gradient Importance (GoGI), a novel metric
accurately identifying functionally relevant tokens by measuring the gradient
influence of their intermediate representations on the final answer loss, and
(2) Adaptive Dynamic Skipping (ADS), a mechanism dynamically regulating the
compression rate based on runtime model uncertainty while ensuring local
coherence through an adaptive N-token constraint. To our knowledge, this is the
first work unifying a goal-oriented, gradient-based importance metric with
dynamic, uncertainty-aware skipping for CoT compression. Trained on compressed
MATH data, Adaptive GoGI-Skip demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization
across diverse reasoning benchmarks including AIME, GPQA, and GSM8K. It
achieves substantial efficiency gains - reducing CoT token counts by over 45%
on average and delivering 1.6-2.0 times inference speedups - while maintaining
high reasoning accuracy. Notably, it significantly outperforms existing
baselines by preserving accuracy even at high effective compression rates,

singular value decomposition (SVD) factors of a centered data-sparsity matrix
that captures next-word co-occurrence patterns. While the model never
explicitly constructs this matrix, learned word and context embeddings
effectively factor it to capture linguistic structure. We find that the most
important SVD factors are learned first during training, motivating the use of
spectral clustering of embeddings to identify human-interpretable semantics,

each question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., ""Is

  Efficient Adaptive Search Agent","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning

capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This
can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and
increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and
adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and
synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external)

Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could
indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal
knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed
insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward
function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed
for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to
deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage

reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Despite its effectiveness,
reward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization,
losing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study
the cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the
RLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs
in unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state
norms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise
sum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch,
constraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR
in improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization,
where BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare
the plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust
RMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR
to high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B
scale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By
conducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length

we introduce the \textbf{Victim Data-based Adversarial Attack (VDBA)}, which

create a shadow dataset with publicly available pre-trained models and

  Concurrently, we use diverse adversarial example generation, employing
various attack methods to generate and select the adversarial example with

protocol QA, BioProBench provides a comprehensive suite of five core tasks:
Protocol Question Answering, Step Ordering, Error Correction, Protocol
Generation, and Protocol Reasoning, enabling a holistic evaluation of LLMs on
procedural biological texts. Built upon 27K original protocols, it yields
nearly 556K high-quality structured instances. We evaluate 12 mainstream
open/closed-source LLMs on BioProBench. Experimental results reveal that while
top models preform well on surface understanding tasks, struggle significantly
with deep reasoning and structured generation tasks like ordering and

bio-specific small models lag behind general LLMs, indicating limitations on
complex procedural content. Overall, our findings underscore that procedural

relationship (entailment, contradiction, or neutral) between a given premise
and hypothesis. This task presents significant challenges due to inherent
linguistic features such as diverse phrasing, semantic complexity, and
contextual nuances. While Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) built upon the
Transformer architecture have yielded substantial advancements in NLI,
prevailing methods predominantly utilize representations from the terminal
layer. This reliance on final-layer outputs may overlook valuable information
encoded in intermediate layers, potentially limiting the capacity to model
intricate semantic interactions effectively. Addressing this gap, we introduce
the Cascaded Interactive Reasoning Network (CIRN), a novel architecture
designed for deeper semantic comprehension in NLI. CIRN implements a
hierarchical feature extraction strategy across multiple network depths,
operating within an interactive space where cross-sentence information is
continuously integrated. This mechanism aims to mimic a process of progressive
reasoning, transitioning from surface-level feature matching to uncovering more
profound logical and semantic connections between the premise and hypothesis.
By systematically mining latent semantic relationships at various
representational levels, CIRN facilitates a more thorough understanding of the

  Name-Based Nationality Detection Models","Most web and digital trace data do not include information about an
individual's nationality due to privacy concerns. The lack of data on
nationality can create challenges for migration research. It can lead to a
left-censoring issue since we are uncertain about the migrant's country of
origin. Once we observe an emigration event, if we know the nationality, we can
differentiate it from return migration. We propose methods to detect the
nationality with the least available data, i.e., full names. We use the
detected nationality in comparison with the country of academic origin, which
is a common approach in studying the migration of researchers. We gathered 2.6
million unique name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and categorized them into
families of nationalities with three granularity levels to use as our training
data. Using a character-based machine learning model, we achieved a weighted F1
score of 84% for the broadest and 67% for the most granular, country-level
categorization. In our empirical study, we used the trained and tested model to
assign nationality to 8+ million scholars' full names in Scopus data. Our
results show that using the country of first publication as a proxy for
nationality underestimates the size of return flows, especially for countries
with a more diverse academic workforce, such as the USA, Australia, and Canada.
We found that around 48% of emigration from the USA was return migration once
we used the country of name origin, in contrast to 33% based on academic
origin. In the most recent period, 79% of scholars whose affiliation has
consistently changed from the USA to China, and are considered emigrants, have
Chinese names in contrast to 41% with a Chinese academic origin. Our proposed
methods for addressing left-censoring issues are beneficial for other research

in both setups LLMs have higher accuracy on guidance intended for the general

In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme

regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve
relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed

prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to
guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make
interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves
three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to
generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations,
providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc
Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations
generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from
candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM
Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as
in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the
performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs.
Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average
accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse
domains.",2025-05-09T02:57:39Z,"Ruxue Shi, Hengrui Gu, Xu Shen, Xin Wang"

upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality
multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or

(1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal
encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a
preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite
relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained
with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue
type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a
vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing
knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align
downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly
improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type

show that the models often but not always degrade under higher spuriousness.
The preference-based methods (DPO/KTO) can demonstrate relative robustness in

The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which
encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of
relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing
various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions
between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture
relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we
attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning
modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it
is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to
the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the
input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges:
overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the

mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former
modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local

X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of

different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating
explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that
performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.
However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group
complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can
significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity,
while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting
for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research
should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect
on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios
differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All
in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group
recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller

auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable
sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual

these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive
ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of
an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context
interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing

that limits knowledge integration and cross-task adaptability; 2) excessive
reliance on domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which neglects
the broader applicability of general language patterns; and 3) inefficient
inference acceleration for large models processing long contexts. In this work,
we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase
framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while
retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based
learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to
expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3)
distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit
distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving
1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results

  Next-Token Prediction","As large language models (LLMs) continue to be deployed and utilized across
domains, the volume of LLM-generated data is growing rapidly. This trend
highlights the increasing importance of effective and lossless compression for
such data in modern text management systems. However, compressing LLM-generated
data presents unique challenges compared to traditional human- or
machine-generated content. Traditional machine-generated data is typically
derived from computational processes or device outputs, often highly structured
and limited to low-level elements like labels or numerical values. This
structure enables conventional lossless compressors to perform efficiently. In
contrast, LLM-generated data is more complex and diverse, requiring new
approaches for effective compression. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of lossless compression techniques tailored
specifically to LLM-generated data. Notably, because LLMs are trained via
next-token prediction, we find that LLM-generated data is highly predictable
for the models themselves. This predictability enables LLMs to serve as
efficient compressors of their own outputs. Through extensive experiments with
14 representative LLMs and 8 LLM-generated datasets from diverse domains, we
show that LLM-based prediction methods achieve remarkable compression rates,
exceeding 20x, far surpassing the 3x rate achieved by Gzip, a widely used
general-purpose compressor. Furthermore, this advantage holds across different
LLM sizes and dataset types, demonstrating the robustness and practicality of
LLM-based methods in lossless text compression under generative AI workloads.",2025-05-07T17:42:35Z,"Yu Mao, Holger Pirk, Chun Jason Xue"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04588v2,ZeroSearch: Incentivize the Search Capability of LLMs without Searching,"Effective information searching is essential for enhancing the reasoning and
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent research has
explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities
by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these
approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1)
Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search
engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the
training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires
frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search
requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain
scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a novel RL
framework that incentivizes the capabilities of LLMs to use a real search
engine with simulated searches during training. Our approach begins with
lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module
capable of generating both useful and noisy documents in response to a query.
During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that
incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively
eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly
challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B
LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves
comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module
even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and
instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a
wide range of RL algorithms.",2025-05-07T17:30:22Z,"Hao Sun, Zile Qiao, Jiayan Guo, Xuanbo Fan, Yingyan Hou, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Yan Zhang, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou"

or present biases, exposing users to misinformation and influencing opinions.
Educating users on their risks is key to responsible use, as bias, unlike
hallucinations, cannot be caught through data verification. We quantify the
political bias of popular LLMs in the context of the recent vote of the German

especially political biases, often finding them small. We challenge this
prevailing wisdom. First, by comparing 31 LLMs to legislators, judges, and a
nationally representative sample of U.S. voters, we show that LLMs' apparently
small overall partisan preference is the net result of offsetting extreme views
on specific topics, much like moderate voters. Second, in a randomized
experiment, we show that LLMs can promulgate their preferences into political
persuasiveness even in information-seeking contexts: voters randomized to
discuss political issues with an LLM chatbot are as much as 5 percentage points
more likely to express the same preferences as that chatbot. Contrary to
expectations, these persuasive effects are not moderated by familiarity with
LLMs, news consumption, or interest in politics. LLMs, especially those
controlled by private companies or governments, may become a powerful and

health and care outcomes. The effectiveness of such conversations has been
linked not only to the exchange of clinical information, but also to a range of
interpersonal behaviors; commonly referred to as social signals, which are
often conveyed through non-verbal cues and shape the quality of the
patient-provider relationship. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated an increasing ability to infer emotional and social behaviors
even when analyzing only textual information. As automation increases also in
clinical settings, such as for transcription of patient-provider conversations,
there is growing potential for LLMs to automatically analyze and extract social
behaviors from these interactions. To explore the foundational capabilities of
LLMs in tracking social signals in clinical dialogue, we designed task-specific
prompts and evaluated model performance across multiple architectures and
prompting styles using a highly imbalanced, annotated dataset spanning 20
distinct social signals such as provider dominance, patient warmth, etc. We

accessibility refers not only to making legal documents available to the
public, but also rendering legal information comprehensible to them. A vexing
problem in bringing legal information to the public is how to turn formal legal
documents such as legislation and judgments, which are often highly technical,
to easily navigable and comprehensible knowledge to those without legal
education. In this study, we formulate a three-step approach for bringing legal
knowledge to laypersons, tackling the issues of navigability and
comprehensibility. First, we translate selected sections of the law into
snippets (called CLIC-pages), each being a small piece of article that focuses
on explaining certain technical legal concept in layperson's terms. Second, we
construct a Legal Question Bank (LQB), which is a collection of legal questions
whose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive
CLIC Recommender (CRec). Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation
that requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists
questions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given
legal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant
legal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects
of creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such

optimising predictive performance is insufficient, as the quantification of
uncertainty is equally crucial. This paper investigates the relationship
between predictive uncertainty, derived from Bayesian Deep Learning
approximations, and human/linguistic uncertainty, as estimated from free-text
radiology reports labelled by rule-based labellers. Utilising BERT as the model
of choice, this study evaluates different binarisation methods for uncertainty
labels and explores the efficacy of Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles in
estimating predictive uncertainty. The results demonstrate good model
performance, but also a modest correlation between predictive and linguistic
uncertainty, highlighting the challenges in aligning machine uncertainty with
human interpretation nuances. Our findings suggest that while Bayesian
approximations provide valuable uncertainty estimates, further refinement is
necessary to fully capture and utilise the subtleties of human uncertainty in
clinical applications.",2025-05-06T18:34:37Z,"Gianluca Manzo, Julia Ive"

speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most
common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still

of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time
conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully

language models to provide high-quality data for model alignment. By employing
MoAA, we enhance both supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization,
leading to improved performance compared to using a single model alone to
generate alignment data (e.g. using GPT-4o alone). Evaluation results show that
our approach can improve win rate of LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct from 19.5 to 48.3 on
Arena-Hard and from 22.33 to 57.23 on AlpacaEval2, highlighting a promising
direction for model alignment through this new scalable and diverse synthetic
data recipe. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MoAA enables a self-improvement
pipeline, where models finetuned on MoA-generated data surpass their own
initial capabilities, providing evidence that our approach can push the
frontier of open-source LLMs without reliance on stronger external supervision.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03054v2,BLAB: Brutally Long Audio Bench,"Developing large audio language models (LMs) capable of understanding diverse
spoken interactions is essential for accommodating the multimodal nature of
human communication and can increase the accessibility of language technologies
across different user populations. Recent work on audio LMs has primarily
evaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30
seconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments
that more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We
introduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio
benchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation,
emotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in
length. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each
paired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers.
Our audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent
a human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six
open-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them,
including advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the
tasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the
trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that
audio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as
duration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning,
counting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on
prompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework

toxic or copyrighted text -- from their pre-training data to prevent models
from generating similar outputs. However, removing such data altogether limits
models' ability to recognize and appropriately respond to harmful or sensitive
content. In this paper, we introduce Selective Loss to Understand but Not
Generate (SLUNG), a pre-training paradigm through which models learn to
understand high-risk data without learning to generate it. Instead of uniformly
applying the next-token prediction loss, SLUNG selectively avoids incentivizing
the generation of high-risk tokens while ensuring they remain within the
model's context window. As the model learns to predict low-risk tokens that
follow high-risk ones, it is forced to understand the high-risk content.
Through our experiments, we show that SLUNG consistently improves models'
understanding of high-risk data (e.g., ability to recognize toxic content)
without increasing its generation (e.g., toxicity of model responses). Overall,
our SLUNG paradigm enables models to benefit from high-risk text that would

self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds
guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and
disregards different numbers of outputs.
  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the
generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing
a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs

task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K,
30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess

  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning

Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to
diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base
models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather
than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative

the button is disabled, don't click it again"", or ""This agent has too much
autonomy to decide what to do on its own"", into metrics for evaluating
fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by
grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and
negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and
concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as
evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a

Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate
AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the

system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval
decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context
reinforcement learning.
  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an

  Post-Training and Test-Time Scaling of Large Language Models","Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from
pre-training scaling to post-training and test-time scaling. Across these
developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where
reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has
underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement
learning (in RLHF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc
correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive
learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows
LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities. In this survey,
we present a comprehensive overview of the paradigm of learning from rewards.
We categorize and analyze the strategies under this paradigm across training,

this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models - Reasoning
Reward Models (ReasRMs) - which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task.

self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and
evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of RM-R1 consists of

  using diffusion model","Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one
language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language
translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural

context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech
translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current

task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target
speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for
high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion
strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel
spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and

However, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to

of several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from
large-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the
G-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of
DNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples. A
Transformer-based G-gram encoder is also proposed and the matched G-grams are
fed into it to compute their representations and integrated into the encoder
for basic unit (E4BU), which is responsible for encoding small units and

are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these
attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or
logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the
multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate
both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to
break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws
incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach
that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker
Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence
retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the

semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the
Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the
prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger
structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level
substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes.
Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on
binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for

  Language Models?","This study investigates the necessity and impact of a detailed rubric in
automated essay scoring (AES) using large language models (LLMs). While using
rubrics are standard in LLM-based AES, creating detailed rubrics requires
substantial ef-fort and increases token usage. We examined how different levels
of rubric detail affect scoring accuracy across multiple LLMs using the TOEFL11
dataset. Our experiments compared three conditions: a full rubric, a simplified
rubric, and no rubric, using four different LLMs (Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemini 1.5
Flash, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama 3 70B Instruct). Results showed that three out of
four models maintained similar scoring accuracy with the simplified rubric
compared to the detailed one, while significantly reducing token usage.
However, one model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) showed decreased performance with more
detailed rubrics. The findings suggest that simplified rubrics may be
sufficient for most LLM-based AES applications, offering a more efficient
alternative without compromis-ing scoring accuracy. However, model-specific

  Similarity-Degree-Based Sampling","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various
natural language processing tasks; however, their application to graph-related
problems remains limited, primarily due to scalability constraints and the
absence of dedicated mechanisms for processing graph structures. Existing
approaches predominantly integrate LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
using GNNs as feature encoders or auxiliary components. However, directly
encoding graph structures within LLMs has been underexplored, particularly in
the context of large-scale graphs where token limitations hinder effective
representation. To address these challenges, we propose SDM-InstructGLM, a
novel instruction-tuned Graph Language Model (InstructGLM) framework that
enhances scalability and efficiency without relying on GNNs. Our method
introduces a similarity-degree-based biased random walk mechanism, which
selectively samples and encodes graph information based on node-feature
similarity and degree centrality, ensuring an adaptive and structured
representation within the LLM. This approach significantly improves token
efficiency, mitigates information loss due to random sampling, and enhances
performance on graph-based tasks such as node classification and link
prediction. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-only
graph processing, enabling scalable and interpretable Graph Language Models

  Benchmark","The importance of benchmarks for assessing the values of language models has
been pronounced due to the growing need of more authentic, human-aligned
responses. However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations

often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to
generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value
Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value
orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of
items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of
assessment results to real-world LLM usage and thus ecological validity.
Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their
own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual
value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that
items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for
assessing those values. Through evaluating 27 LLMs with our benchmark, we find
that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values

  Generation Quality of Generative Linguistic Steganographic Texts","Generating high-quality steganographic text is a fundamental challenge in the
field of generative linguistic steganography. This challenge arises primarily
from two aspects: firstly, the capabilities of existing models in text
generation are limited; secondly, embedding algorithms fail to effectively
mitigate the negative impacts of sensitive information's properties, such as
semantic content or randomness. Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can
accurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to
consider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities. This
phenomenon leads to a decrease in the number of high-probability candidate
words and an increase in low-probability candidate words, thereby compromising
the semantic coherence and logical fluency of the steganographic text and
diminishing the overall quality of the generated steganographic material. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a novel embedding algorithm,
character-based diffusion embedding algorithm (CDEA). Unlike existing embedding
algorithms that strive to eliminate the impact of sensitive information's
properties on the generation process, CDEA leverages sensitive information's
properties. It enhances the selection frequency of high-probability candidate
words in the candidate pool based on general statistical properties at the
character level and grouping methods based on power-law distributions, while
reducing the selection frequency of low-probability candidate words in the
candidate pool. Furthermore, to ensure the effective transformation of
sensitive information in long sequences, we also introduce the XLNet model.

layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training
dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a
one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer
well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer
transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of
attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase,
the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable
vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the
linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin

feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical
problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is
a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math
critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too
shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and
struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct
mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage
framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on
each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for
supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise
critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth
critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform
reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing
human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained
via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize
its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct

  finetuning: a controlled study","Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show
surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning. E.g. they can fail to
generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, or fail to
make simple logical deductions based on trained information. These failures to
generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.
On the other hand, language models' in-context learning shows different
inductive biases, and can generalize better in some cases. Here, we explore
these differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based
learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and
improve models' abilities to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are
designed to create clean tests of generalization, by isolating the knowledge in
the dataset from that in pretraining. We expose pretrained large models to
controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,
or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that
require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched
settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning
(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when
fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of
knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved
generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning
data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of
our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for

prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes
messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is
crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets
state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such
methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known
triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the
process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.
Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that
fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task
type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data
augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to
iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose
reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting
token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating
position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on
superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our

hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more
efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),
a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice
routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing
arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of
length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head
from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same
computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the
tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the
dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical
compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense
self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,
perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,
require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the
KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.",2025-05-01T05:22:11Z,"Piotr Piękos, Róbert Csordás, Jürgen Schmidhuber"

Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the
problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from
teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that
ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's

to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct
necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL
performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have
been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We
investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM
performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to
cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach
to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by
cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces
skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose
AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the

http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00038v1,HyPerAlign: Hypotheses-driven Personalized Alignment,"Alignment algorithms are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) to
human users based on preference annotations that reflect their intended
real-world use cases. Typically these (often divergent) preferences are
aggregated over a diverse set of users, resulting in fine-tuned models that are
aligned to the ``average-user'' preference. Nevertheless, current models are
used by individual users in very specific contexts and situations, emphasizing
the need for user-dependent preference control. In this work we address the
problem of personalizing LLM outputs to their users, aiming to generate
customized responses tailored to individual users, instead of generic outputs
that emulate the collective voices of diverse populations. We propose a novel
interpretable and sample-efficient hypotheses-driven personalization approach
(HyPerAlign) where given few-shot examples written by a particular user, we
first infer hypotheses about their communication strategies, personality and
writing style, then prompt LLM models with these hypotheses and user specific
attributes to generate customized outputs. We conduct experiments on two
different personalization tasks, authorship attribution and deliberative
alignment, with datasets from diverse domains (news articles, blog posts,
emails, jailbreaking benchmarks), and demonstrate the superiority of
hypotheses-driven personalization approach when compared to preference-based
fine-tuning methods. For deliberative alignment, the helpfulness of LLM models
is improved by up to $70\%$ on average. For authorship attribution, results
indicate consistently high win-rates (commonly $>90\%$) against
state-of-the-art preference fine-tuning approaches for LLM personalization
across diverse user profiles and LLM models. Overall, our approach represents
an interpretable and sample-efficient strategy for the personalization of LLM
models to individual users.",2025-04-29T18:01:46Z,"Cristina Garbacea, Chenhao Tan"

answering but require updates to incorporate new knowledge and reduce
inaccuracies and hallucinations. Traditional updating methods, like fine-tuning
and incremental learning, face challenges such as overfitting and high
computational costs. Knowledge Editing (KE) provides a promising alternative
but often overlooks the Knowledge Element Overlap (KEO) phenomenon, where
multiple triplets share common elements, leading to editing conflicts. We
identify the prevalence of KEO in existing KE datasets and show its significant
impact on current KE methods, causing performance degradation in handling such
triplets. To address this, we propose a new formulation, Knowledge Set Editing

(LLMs) in generating complete specification code pertaining to operating system
kernel verification tasks. The benchmark first defines the specification
generation problem into a program synthesis problem within a confined scope of
syntax and semantics by providing LLMs with the programming model. The LLMs are
required to understand the provided verification assumption and the potential
syntax and semantics space to search for, then generate the complete

semantic space of the model, creating gravitational potential wells that
""attract"" tokens during generation. This model offers a mechanism to explain

http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00036v1,"A Framework to Assess the Persuasion Risks Large Language Model Chatbots
  Pose to Democratic Societies","In recent years, significant concern has emerged regarding the potential
threat that Large Language Models (LLMs) pose to democratic societies through
their persuasive capabilities. We expand upon existing research by conducting
two survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine
whether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using
LLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into
account both the ""receive"" and ""accept"" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller
1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended
interactions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot
interactions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects
(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced
content). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct
political domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual
campaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the
real-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact
conditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we
estimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \$48-\$74 per persuaded voter
compared to \$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the
costs of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional
campaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not
currently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale
political persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM
capabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage
exposure to persuasive LLMs.",2025-04-29T16:02:51Z,"Zhongren Chen, Joshua Kalla, Quan Le, Shinpei Nakamura-Sakai, Jasjeet Sekhon, Ruixiao Wang"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879v2,The Leaderboard Illusion,"Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field.
As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more
susceptible to distortion. Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard
for ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify
systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that
undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are
able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if
desired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best
score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance
results. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in
the lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed
models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models
removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both
these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like
Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the
arena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only
received an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot
Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result
in relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on
our conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to
Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on

This work presents ``X-Cross'' -- a novel cross-domain

integrating several domain-specific language models; each model is fine-tuned

by layer, X-Cross dynamically refines the representation of each source

representations are propagated from one layer to the next, leveraging the
activations from each domain adapter to ensure domain-specific nuances are
preserved while enabling adaptability across domains. Using Amazon datasets for
sequential recommendation, X-Cross achieves performance comparable to a model
that is fine-tuned with LoRA, while using only 25% of the additional
parameters. In cross-domain tasks, such as adapting from Toys domain to Tools,
Electronics or Sports, X-Cross demonstrates robust performance, while requiring
about 50%-75% less fine-tuning data than LoRA to make fine-tuning effective.
Furthermore, X-Cross achieves significant improvement in accuracy over
